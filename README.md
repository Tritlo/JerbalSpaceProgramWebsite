Jerbal Space Program
====================

Jerbal Space Program is a game in which you build design spaceship parts from scratch,
and then you use those parts to design spaceships.

This project is a website that runs the game, with a quickstart localplay mode,
and then social designing and sharing of parts, with multiplayer capabilities (when flying a shared ship);

This was the final project in Web Programming at the University of Iceland. Project members were Matthías Páll Gissurarson and Sólrún Halla Einarsdóttir.

The multiplayer is still in beta, bear that in mind!
