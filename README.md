Jerbal Space Program
====================

Jerbal Space Program is a game in which you build design spaceshipparts from scratch,
and then you use those parts to design spaceships.

This project is a website that runs the game, with a quickstart localplay mode,
and then social designing and sharing of parts, with multiplayer capabilities (when flying a shared ship);

This was the final project in both Computer Game Programming and Web Programming at the
University of Iceland. Project members were Matthías Páll Gissurarson, Haukur Óskar Þorgeirsson, Sólrún Halla Einarsdóttir and Bjarki Geir Benediktsson. Matthías Páll and Sólrún Halla made the website.

The multiplayer is still in beta, bear that in mind!
